# BetaCompiler
Beta Release of the Aardvark Compiler

First, download and run the installer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

# How does it work?
The internals of the compiler are currently closed-source, but we'll open source it once it's been thoroughly bug-tested.

# Why should I use it?
You should use Aardvark, because pointer arithmetic is easier than pointer algebra.
